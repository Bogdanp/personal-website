I released [net-ip] -- a small Racket library for working with IP (v4
and v6) addresses and networks -- today.  I needed this to be able to
work on another library I'm going to release at some point in the
future for doing geo-location based on Maxmind's databases.  Check it
out and let me know what you think!
