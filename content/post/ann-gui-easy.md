These past couple of months, I've been working on a library for
building declarative GUIs in Racket.  It's called [gui-easy] and it
works by wrapping `racket/gui`.  See the [examples] directory to get
an idea about how it's meant to be used, or watch the demo below:

<div align="center">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AXJ9tTVGDwU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The library is still a work in progress so expect some breaking
changes.  If you use it, let me know what you think!
