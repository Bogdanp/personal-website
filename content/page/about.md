You've reached Bogdan Popa's personal website.  Welcome!

I've been working as a professional software engineer for the past
decade.  In that time span I have worked on a variety of problems
ranging from low-level video streaming on mobile devices to real time
analytics, device fingerprinting, landing page optimization and fraud
detection.

Currently, I'm the CTO of [Matchacha].  Previously, I was the CTO of
[BlockFraud], a mobile fraud detection SaaS, and, before that, I was a
Principal Engineer at [Leadpages].  In my free time I contribute to
and maintain [dramatiq], [molten] and a bunch of other OSS which you
can find [here](/page/projects/) and on [my GitHub page][gh].

If you want to get in touch, [email][em] me, or send me an
[encrypted message][kb].  Find out about new posts by subscribing
to the [Atom][feed] feed or follow me on [Twitter][twitter].
