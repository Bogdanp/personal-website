You've reached Bogdan Popa's personal website.  Welcome!

I've been working as a professional software engineer for the past 8
years.  In that time span I have worked on a variety of problems
ranging from low-level video streaming on mobile devices to real time
analytics, device fingerprinting, landing page optimization and fraud
detection.

I'm currently the CTO of [BlockFraud], a mobile fraud detection SaaS.
Previously, I was a Principal Engineer at [Leadpages].  In my free
time I contribute to and maintain [dramatiq], [molten] and a bunch of
other OSS which you can find [here](/page/projects/) and on [my GitHub
page][gh].

If you want to get in touch, [email][em] me, or send me an
[encrypted message][kb].  Find out about new posts by subscribing
to the [Atom][feed] feed or follow me on [Twitter][twitter].
