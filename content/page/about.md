You've reached Bogdan Popa's personal website.  Welcome!

I've been working as a professional software engineer for the past
13 years. In that time span I have worked on a variety of problems
ranging from low-level video streaming on mobile devices to real time
mobile analytics, device fingerprinting, landing page optimization,
fraud detection and scaling databases and systems containing tens of
terabytes of financial data.

I built and operate [Matchacha], a Romanian e-commerce business that
imports and sells Japanese green tea and I currently work part-time
at [Nomics], where I run the API and the data ingestion platform. I'm
also working with [Marc Kaufmann][Marc] on [congame], an experimental
economics platform. Previously, I was the CTO of [BlockFraud], a mobile
fraud detection SaaS, and, before that, I was a Principal Engineer at
[Leadpages].

In my free time, I like to contribute to the [Racket] programming
language and ecosystem. I maintain [koyo], [dramatiq], [molten] and a
bunch of other OSS which you can find on my [projects](/page/projects/)
page and on [my GitHub profile][gh].

If you want to get in touch, [email][em] me. Find out about new posts by
subscribing to the [Atom][feed] feed or follow me on [Twitter][twitter].
